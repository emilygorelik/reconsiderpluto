/*
The history of Pluto's discovery began in the mid-19th century when the
mathematical astronomy of Urbain Le Verrier predicted the existence and
position of Neptune, prompting astronomers to speculate about planets
beyond its orbit. In 1906, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian who had
founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1894, started an
extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed
"Planet X". By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested
several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet. Lowell and his
observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no
avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of
Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for
what they were.
